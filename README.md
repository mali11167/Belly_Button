# Belly_Button
# Overview
This project focuses on visualization of the bacterial data for each volunteer. The volunteers are able to identify top 10 bacterial species in
their naval. 
We created bar, bubble and gauge chart to identify data for each volunteer. It gives a very detailed information of each volunteer in terms of gender,
ethinicity, age and the visualization is shown as per top 10 bacteria found, bacteria culture per sample and belley button washing frequency scrubs per
week.
